## 4. Functional Modeling & Design Flow

BabySoC introduces learners to the **three core stages** of SoC development:

---

### 🧪 Functional Modeling

- High-level behavior simulation (pre-RTL)
- Tests CPU logic, DAC outputs, PLL stability
- Detects design bugs early
- Does **not** require RTL or layout tools

---

### 🧱 RTL Design (Register-Transfer Level)

- Hardware is described using **Verilog or VHDL**
- Defines timing, registers, control signals
- Enables simulation, synthesis, and testing at clock level

---

### 🏗️ Physical Design

- RTL is converted to silicon layout
- Optimized for power, area, and performance
- Final preparation for chip fabrication

![Design Flow Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/558c672b-5942-419a-9f48-839693d301ec)

> BabySoC emphasizes **functional modeling first**, helping learners build a strong base before diving into RTL or physical design.
